 * changeOrderStatus
 * ---------------------------
 * This function changes the status of an existing order in the database.
 *
 * Step by step:
 * 1. We receive an object containing the order id and the new status.
 * 2. We run a Prisma "update" command on the "order" table, targeting a record that has the matching id.
 * 3. We set the "status" field to the new status we were provided.
 *
 * Even a 5-year-old description:
 * "We have an order and we want to say if it's 'Sent', 'Canceled', or anything else.
 *  So we open our big box (the database) with all the 'orders,' find the one that matches the special id,
 *  and then change its 'status' label to the new one."
 *
 * Note: This file has no CSS or class names, so there are no style references here.
